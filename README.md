# DisplayDisabler

**A tiny macOS menu-bar app for total control of your Mac's displays.**

Disable & enable screens · Force HiDPI · brightness with EDR boost · color warmth · window transparency, blur, keep-on-top & picture-in-picture · keep-awake — a free, lightweight alternative to the big commercial display utilities.

## ✨ Features

| | |
|---|---|
| 🖥️ **Disable / enable any display** | Turn off the built-in panel in clamshell/headless setups so it stays off when the lid opens. Optionally auto-disable the built-in whenever an external monitor connects. |
| ⤢ **Force HiDPI** | Add crisp scaled (retina) resolutions to displays that don't natively offer them, via a mirrored private `SLVirtualDisplay`, plus a "More Space" supersampling tier. Optionally writes **persistent "crisp HiDPI" override plists**. |
| ☀️ **Brightness + boost** | Built-in panel via `DisplayServices`, externals via DDC/CI, an inline **auto-brightness** toggle, and an **EDR boost above 100%** clamped to the display's real, learned headroom (mild on a built-in, big on a true XDR/HDR panel) — colors preserved, auto-suspends in Mission Control. |
| 🌡️ **Warmth** | Per-display color-temperature slider (f.lux / Night-Shift style) via gamma ramps — 6500 K neutral → ~3400 K warm, persisted, restores native ColorSync at 0%. |
| 🪟 **Window transparency** | Set per-app or all-window opacity for **any** app, via a self-contained scripting addition injected into Dock (no external tools). Optional **frosted-glass blur**, per-app **Keep on top**, and **Picture-in-Picture** (shrink a window into a still-usable floating corner). |
| ☕ **Keep awake** | An IOKit caffeine assertion so the Mac and its display don't sleep — indefinitely or for a set duration. Replaces KeepingYouAwake. |

The menu-bar icon is an interactive **coffee mug**: left-click toggles keep-awake (filled cup = awake), right-click opens the menu.

Per-display brightness (with inline auto-brightness) and warmth sliders, resolution & Force-HiDPI submenus, per-app transparency with frosted-glass / keep-on-top / picture-in-picture toggles, and a grouped Settings submenu.

## 📦 Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/oabdrabo/DisplayDisabler.git
cd DisplayDisabler
make install      # builds, ad-hoc signs, copies to /Applications, launches
```

Needs Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`). It launches at login by default — toggle that under the menu-bar icon → **Settings → Launch at Login**.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **macOS 14+ on Apple Silicon.**
- **Window transparency / blur / keep-on-top** need **SIP disabled** and the `-arm64e_preview_abi` boot-arg — these allow injecting the payload into Dock. First use prompts once for an admin password to install the scripting addition; afterwards it loads silently. *(Display / HiDPI / brightness / warmth work without them.)*
- **Picture-in-Picture** asks for Accessibility permission once.

## 🔧 How it works

- Disabling uses the private `CGSConfigureDisplayEnabled`; Force HiDPI mirrors the panel onto a private `SLVirtualDisplay` pinned to the desired logical size, and "crisp HiDPI" writes display-override plists under `/Library/Displays/.../Overrides`.
- Transparency injects a payload into Dock (`task_for_pid` + an arm64e bootstrap) that calls `SLSSetWindowAlpha` / `SLSSetWindowBackgroundBlurRadius` / `SLSSetWindowLevel` over a private unix socket. The injection technique is adapted from [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) (MIT); see `sa/loader.m`.
- Warmth loads per-channel gamma ramps with the public `CGSetDisplayTransferByTable`; the brightness boost is a borderless EDR overlay (`CAMetalLayer`, multiply blend) clamped each frame to the live `maximumExtendedDynamicRangeColorComponentValue`.
- Picture-in-Picture resizes/moves the real window through the Accessibility API (`AXUIElement`) and reuses Keep-on-top for the float.

Because these are private APIs, behaviour can change between macOS releases.
